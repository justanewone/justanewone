	-- The Delivery Point Address (DPA) is sourced from Royal Mail’s PAF (Postcode Address File) which is a non-geocoded list of addresses. These addresses are used primarily as a ‘mailing list’ for postal purposes.
	-- Geographic Addresses (LPI) are maintained by contributing Local Authorities. The structure of a geographic address is based on the British Standard BS7666. These addresses are used to provide an accurate geographic locator for an object to aid, for example, service delivery, asset management, or command and control operations. They also represent the legal form of addresses as created under street naming and numbering legislation.
